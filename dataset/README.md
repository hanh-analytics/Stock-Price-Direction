# Dataset üñ•Ô∏è
We have data for the period from 1997 up to year 2020 that we have split that into training (`1997-2016`), validation (`2016-2018`) and testing (2018-2020) periods. The data is available in the AMZN_train.csv, AMZN_val.csv and AMZN_test.csv files, respectively.

Each dataset has the same format with the following 7 columns:

`Date` - in format YYYY-MM-DD

`Open` - stock price upon opening of an exchange

`High` - the highest stock price on a given day

`Low` - the lowest stock price on a given day

`Close` - stock price at the end of a trading day

`Adj Close` - adjusted closing price that takes into account corporate actions

`Volume` - the amount of shares traded over the course of a trading day
