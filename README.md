# Stock Price Direction ðŸ§®

This project focuses on predicting the day-to-day price direction of Amazon.com, Inc. stock. Rather than forecasting the exact stock price, the objective is to classify whether the next dayâ€™s closing price will be higher or lower than the opening price.

## Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing is used to evaluate the significance of various factors influencing the stock price direction. By performing statistical tests on features such as volume, opening price, and moving averages, we determine whether these factors are statistically significant in predicting the next day's stock movement. This analysis ensures that the selected features are reliable for the model and that the observed patterns are not due to random chance.

## Model Development
The core of the project involves developing classification models to predict whether the stock price will increase or decrease. Various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, are explored, with hyperparameter tuning applied to optimize performance. The model is trained on historical stock data and evaluated using metrics to ensure it can make reliable predictions for stock price direction.

## Dashboard Creation
Interactive dashboards are developed to visualize the performance of the model and offer insights into temporal patterns in stock prices. The dashboards present key metrics, such as prediction accuracy and model performance over time. Additionally, they help uncover seasonal or cyclical trends, allowing stakeholders to identify the best times to act on predictions. Plotly Dash is used to build visualizations that make the data analysis accessible.

### Background
The stock market is inherently complex and highly volatile, making precise price predictions challenging. However, predicting price direction can still support profitable strategies by offering guidance on market trends without requiring exact price estimations.

### Key Objectives
- Develop a model to classify stock price movement direction (Higher or Lower).
- Analyze historical market data to extract relevant features influencing price direction.
- Evaluate model performance to ensure reliable classification predictions.
- Create dashboards for performance analysis and seasonal/temporal analysis to visualize insights.
- Formulate and test hypotheses regarding the significance of various stock-related features (e.g., volume, moving averages) in predicting the direction of stock price movement, ensuring the reliability of the selected features for the classification model.

## Data Description
We have data for the period from 1997 up to 2020 that has been split into:
- **Training period**: 1997-2016
- **Validation period**: 2016-2018
- **Testing period**: 2018-2020

Each dataset has the following 7 columns:
- **Date**: in format YYYY-MM-DD
- **Open**: stock price upon opening of an exchange
- **High**: the highest stock price on a given day
- **Low**: the lowest stock price on a given day
- **Close**: stock price at the end of a trading day
- **Adj Close**: adjusted closing price that takes into account corporate actions
- **Volume**: the amount of shares traded over the course of a trading day

The data files are available in:
- **AMZN_train.csv**: Training data
- **AMZN_val.csv**: Validation data
- **AMZN_test.csv**: Testing data

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.

5. **Dashboard Creation**  
   Dashboards are developed using Plotly Dash.
   - **Performance Analysis**: Provides a comprehensive view of model metrics and prediction results.
   - **Seasonal or Temporal Analysis**: Visualizes trends and patterns over time, helping identify cyclical behaviors in stock prices.

## Technologies Used
