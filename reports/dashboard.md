# **Dashboard Report: Predicting Stock Price Movements – Insights and Trends**

### 1. **Introduction**
   - **Purpose of the Dashboard**: 
     - Describe the objective of the dashboard (e.g., "This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the predictions made by our machine learning model to determine whether the next day's closing price of Amazon (AMZN) will be higher than its opening price.")
     - Briefly introduce the model's purpose and target variable (e.g., binary classification: `1` for price increase, `0` for no increase).
   - **Target Audience**: 
     - Identify who will benefit from the dashboard (e.g., "This dashboard is designed for analysts, stakeholders, and data scientists to track model performance and gain insights into market behavior patterns.").

### 2. **Model Performance Overview**
   - **Key Metrics**:
     - **Accuracy**: Display the model's overall accuracy and any additional metrics (e.g., F1-score, Precision, Recall).
     - **AUC-ROC Curve**: Provide a graphical representation of the model’s ability to distinguish between the two classes.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Show the confusion matrix to assess how well the model performs in predicting the correct class (price up or not).
   - **Model Evaluation**: Summarize the model's performance and whether it meets the expected outcomes.

### 3. **Prediction vs. Actual Outcomes**
   - **Predicted vs. Actual**:
     - Provide a plot comparing the predicted values to the actual stock movements (e.g., scatter plot or line chart).
     - Highlight any notable patterns, such as periods when the model's predictions were more accurate.
   - **Trend Analysis**:
     - Explore how the predictions align with actual price movements over time.
     - Discuss whether certain periods (e.g., high volatility or market news) led to more accurate or less accurate predictions.

### 4. **Feature Importance and Insights**
   - **Feature Impact on Predictions**:
     - Present a bar chart or table that ranks the most important features (e.g., past closing price, trading volume, etc.) used by the model to make predictions.
   - **Interpretation of Features**:
     - Explain how certain features influence the model’s decision-making. For example, "Higher trading volume tends to correlate with increased price fluctuations, making it a significant feature in predicting price increases."
   - **Visualizing Feature Interactions**:
     - Use partial dependence plots (PDPs) or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to show how changes in key features affect predicted probabilities.

### 5. **Patterns and Trends in Stock Price Movements**
   - **Seasonality or Time-of-Day Effects**:
     - Explore whether there are certain times (e.g., monthly, weekly) when the model performs better or when price increases are more frequent.
     - Show how the predictions vary based on the time of year or specific market conditions (e.g., "Stock price tends to increase more often during earnings season").
   - **Market Volatility**:
     - Analyze the model’s performance during periods of high volatility (e.g., during major stock market events or external news). Highlight whether volatility impacts prediction accuracy.
     - Display charts to visually indicate market volatility against predicted price movements.

### 6. **Model's Ability to Predict Price Movements**
   - **Accuracy Over Time**:
     - Show how the model's accuracy changes over time with respect to the test set.
     - Include a rolling accuracy graph or time-series visualization showing whether predictions are more reliable during certain periods.
   - **Predictions in Real-Time Market Conditions**:
     - Discuss how well the model adapts to real-time changes in the market and whether its predictions reflect current market conditions.

### 7. **Recommendations and Next Steps**
   - **Model Improvement**:
     - Offer suggestions for improving the model based on observed trends (e.g., "Incorporating more technical indicators such as moving averages could enhance model accuracy during volatile market periods").
   - **Data Refinements**:
     - Suggest further feature engineering or data sources that could provide more meaningful insights (e.g., adding macroeconomic indicators or sentiment analysis).
   - **Actionable Insights for Stakeholders**:
     - Provide actionable insights that stakeholders can use to guide decision-making based on the model's predictions (e.g., "Investors could consider using the model’s predictions to make more informed decisions during high-volume trading periods").

### 8. **Conclusion**
   - **Summary of Insights**:
     - Summarize the key insights derived from the dashboard. Focus on the effectiveness of the model, the patterns in stock price movements, and how stakeholders can leverage these findings.
   - **Model's Potential**:
     - Conclude with an assessment of how the model can be used for real-time predictions and its potential for future enhancements.

### 9. **Appendix (Optional)**
   - **Technical Details**:
     - Provide any necessary technical details, such as how the model was built, hyperparameters used, or additional charts that may support deeper analysis.
   - **Glossary**: 
     - Define key terms or concepts that are relevant to understanding the dashboard (e.g., AUC, F1-score, volatility).
