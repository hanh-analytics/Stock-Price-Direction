# Binary Classification

## 1. **Introduction**
   - **Purpose of the Model**: Briefly explain the goal of the binary classification model. For instance, "This model predicts whether the next day's closing price of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) will be higher than its opening price based on historical data."
   - **Target Variable**: Define the target variable (e.g., "The target is binary: 1 if the next day's closing price is higher than the opening price, and 0 if it is not").

## 2. **Data Description**
   - **Dataset**: We have data for the period from 1997 up to year 2020 that we have split that into training (1997-2016), validation (2016-2018) and testing (2018-2020) periods. The data is available in the AMZN_train.csv, AMZN_val.csv and AMZN_test.csv files, respectively.
   - **Features**: Features include moving average over 7 days and 30 days, current price direction, price range, closing price, high, low, volume, and other financial indicators.
   - **Preprocessing**:
     - **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in the columns of test set were imputed using the means value of the columns.  

## 3. **Model Selection**
   - **Algorithms Used**: Mention the classification algorithms used (e.g., "The model was trained using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests").
   - **Model Selection Criteria**: If applicable, explain why certain algorithms were chosen based on the problem characteristics (e.g., "Logistic regression was chosen for its simplicity, while decision trees and random forests were explored for potentially higher accuracy").

## 4. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - **Training Process**: Explain how the model was trained, including any hyperparameter tuning or cross-validation (e.g., "The models were trained using the training set, with hyperparameters optimized via grid search and 5-fold cross-validation").
   - **Metrics Used**: Discuss the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC (e.g., "The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC-AUC score").
   
   **Example Results Section:**
   - **Accuracy**: "The accuracy of the best model was 0.65, indicating that it correctly predicted the outcome 65% of the time."
   - **Precision and Recall**: "The model's precision was 0.62, and recall was 0.58, suggesting a moderate balance between false positives and false negatives."
   - **AUC-ROC**: "The AUC-ROC score was 0.72, demonstrating a good model fit."

## 5. **Results Interpretation**
   - **Model Performance**: Provide an interpretation of the model's performance in the context of your problem. For instance, "Although the accuracy is reasonable, the model's recall suggests that it may miss some of the days where the closing price exceeds the opening price."
   - **Insights**: Include any interesting insights from the model’s performance, such as feature importance, trends in the data, or any areas where the model performed well or poorly.

## 6. **Limitations and Future Work**
   - **Limitations**: Discuss any limitations in the model, data, or evaluation process (e.g., "The model may not fully capture complex market conditions or trends beyond the given features").
   - **Future Improvements**: Suggest potential improvements, such as using additional features, trying different models (e.g., neural networks), or incorporating time-series techniques (e.g., LSTM networks).

## 7. **Conclusion**
   - Summarize the findings and key takeaways from the model’s performance, such as "The model demonstrated a moderate ability to predict whether the closing price will be higher than the opening price. While improvements can be made, it offers a solid foundation for further exploration and enhancement."

By covering these points, you’ll provide a thorough report that explains the problem, model, and results in detail.
