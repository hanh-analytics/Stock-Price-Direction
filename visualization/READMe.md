# Visualization

This folder contains a dashboard and individual figures generated from the analysis of the stock price prediction data. These figures offer visual insights and patterns from the data, but the full interactive dashboard, which includes dynamic features and interactivity, is not included here. To include the interactivity in the dashboard, please download the notebook package and run the code, then view the dashboard on a local port by this url `http://127.0.0.1:8051/`. You can replace the number `8051` with any numbers that you enter at `port=`

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True, port= 8051)
```
